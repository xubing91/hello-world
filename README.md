# hello-world
just for test 

Hi，I’m here, I don't know how to use the GitHub, so I'm here to learn how to use the github.
That's all.

The second chance to learn how to use the GitHub.
First, I delete some words in the privious version. Then I add some words down. 
Now, it's time to show I have learnt how to use the GitHub.
