Hi，I’m here, I don't know how to use the GitHub, so I'm here to learn how to use the github.
That's all.

The second chance to learn how to use the GitHub.
First, I delete some words in the privious version. Then I add some words down. 

This time I'm here to show how to use the GitHub。
Now，I‘ll show you.
